## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- My name is Emma and I am a Devops Engineer specialising in Python, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes and MYSQL. 
- I am also trained in Full-Stack Development (JavaScript, React, Flask, Express.js and Redux).
- I am currently sharpening my Terraform skills and preparing for the AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification.
- My background in teaching, combined with my technical skills, has equipped me with a unique blend of emotional intelligence, problem-solving abilities, and a strong commitment to fostering learning environmentsâ€”qualities that I am eager to bring to a DevOps role.
