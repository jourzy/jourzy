## Hi there 👋

- My name is Emma and I am a Software Engineer specialising in Python, MYSQL, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform. 
- I am also trained in Full-Stack Development (JavaScript, React, Flask, Express.js and Redux).
- My background in teaching, combined with my technical skills, has equipped me with a unique blend of emotional intelligence, problem-solving abilities, and a strong commitment to fostering learning environments—qualities that I am eager to bring to a Software Engineering role.
